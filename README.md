## What the heck is appcast?

The word "appcast" is usually referred to a remote web page providing
information about software updates. This kind of pages are usually generated by
different frameworks ([Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/)) or services that
distribute applications ([SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/), [GitHub](https://github.com/)
and etc.). There are plenty of different methods available, but originally
"appcasting" was the practice of using an [RSS enclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_enclosure)
to distribute updates and release notes.

## Why is this library needed?

Since today you can find plenty of different ways how vendors distribute their
software updates, this library attempts to provide a universal way for supported
providers of analyzing and retrieving useful information from appcasts.

## Supported providers

At the moment, only 3 providers are supported:

- [Sparkle RSS Feed](https://sparkle-project.org/)
- [SourceForge RSS Feed](https://sourceforge.net/)
- [GitHub Atom Feed](https://github.com/)
